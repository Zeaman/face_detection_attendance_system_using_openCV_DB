# face_detection_attendance_system_using_openCV_DB
**Face Attendance System** detects faces via _IP-camera_ using Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano 8GB Devkit, logs attendance with confidence scoring, and stores records in _SQLite_. Built with Python (_Flask + OpenCV_), it features real-time web viewing with detection overlays and manual save capability for workplace/classroom tracking.

**Face Attendance System** is a real-time face detection and attendance tracking solution that leverages IP camera feeds to automatically record and manage attendance entries. Built with Python (Flask backend) and OpenCV for face detection, the system processes live video streams, detects faces with confidence scoring, and logs attendance entries into an _SQLite database_. The web interface provides a live video feed with detection overlays, real-time status updates, and manual saving of detected faces. Designed for environments requiring automated attendance tracking, such as workplaces or classrooms, this system offers a simple yet effective way to monitor presence while maintaining records with timestamps and confidence-based approval status. Future enhancements can include face recognition, multi-camera support, and reporting features.

Face Attendance System with IP Camera Integration
A real-time face detection and attendance tracking system that uses IP camera feeds to automatically record and manage attendance with confidence-based verification.
